== Project Structure ==

Although initially not intended, the Eclipse project ended up in a dedicated folder, so it's now eve-upro/eve-upro.
But I don't see too much of a problem with that - makes the readme stand out more.

== Used Tools for Development ==

I'm using
* Eclipse Indigo
** Plugins
*** for JavaScript development
*** for PHP development
