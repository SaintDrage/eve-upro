= EVE upro - README =

== Project Structure ==

Although initially not intended, the Eclipse project ended up in a dedicated folder, so it's now eve-upro/eve-upro.
But I don't see too much of a problem with that - makes the readme stand out more.

== Used Tools for Development ==

I'm using
* Eclipse Indigo
** Plugins
*** for JavaScript development
*** for PHP development
*** MakeGood for PHP unit tests: http://redmine.piece-framework.com/
*** JsTestDriver for JavaScript unit tests: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/
*** PlantUML: http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/eclipse.html
* XAMPP 1.7.7
* Selenium RC 2.21.0

== Test Environment ==
Integration tests and MySQL tests depend on some system setup that must be provided.
All configurable parameter (such as addresses) are collected in the TestEnvironment class
(test/php/TestSupport/TestEnvironment.php)

This class also has master kill-switches for MySQL based or Selenium based tests. If these report the respective
component not available, the dependent tests will be marked as skipped (instead of blocking for connect timeout).

The default values are given here:
=== Database ===
* server: localhost
* user: upro_test
* password: test
* database: upro_unittests

The user must have all rights (creating/deleting tables, ...) on the database and the database should be empty.    

=== Selenium ===
* browser: googlechrome
* base URL: http://localhost/upro-test/php/IntegrationTests/

At best, configure the web server to have <server>/upro-test resolve to the <project-dir>/test directory.
Selenium must be started manually.
